## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS framework
- [RxJS]

### What I learned

This project was a means to learn Angular. I learned that Services are a great way to share information among classes that do not know each other. Additionally, I learned how to use reactive forms.

### Continued development

I plan to continue to explore more features of angular and improve my understanding of RxJS.

### Useful resources

- [https://angular.io/docs] - This helped me understand how to create an application in angular.
- [https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview] - This is an amazing website that helped understand how to react to changes within my application.
